description: We have designed an experiment to exclude 50% of rainfall from a temperate forest stand in Morgantown, WV. The experiment is testing how the extreme drought conditions predicted from climate change will change tree physiology and microbial function. We hypothesize the drought, like other environmental stressors, will weaken plant-microbial relationship and decrease carbon sequestration. If our hypothesis is correct, less carbon storage will become a positive feedback for climate change, creating more even extreme droughts.
