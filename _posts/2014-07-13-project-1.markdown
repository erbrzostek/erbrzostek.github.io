description: Our outreach program is designed to make our research accessible to our local and regional communities, while also providing a chance for people to interact with our experiments in the field. We hold two annual outreach events designed to expose children and adults to all aspects of ecosystems science. We also help integrate ecosystem experiments into curriculum.
