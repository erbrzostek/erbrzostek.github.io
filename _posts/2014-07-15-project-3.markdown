description: Ecosystem models are limited by information about how microbial communities impact nutrient cycling. Until now, microbial communities have been treated as a 'black box' through which nutrients flow. We designed a and to simultaneously track the flow of carbon and nitrogen through plants and soil, while also monitoring how microbial communities change. We are using the information we gather to build the first ecosystem model to incorporate microbial community and metagenomic information.
