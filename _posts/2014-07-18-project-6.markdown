description: The sustainability of bioenergy production relies on growing feedstocks that retain nutrients and enhance soil carbon. We use an integrated model-experiment approach to refine our predictive understanding of how plant-microbial interactions impact soil C and N cycling in bioenergy systems. Recently, we released our new model FUN-BioCROP which is the first bioenergy ecosystem model to simulate explicit microbes and their interactions with plants in the rhizosphere. We continue to refine the model across three fronts: using experiments to parameterize microbial traits, develop an independent microbial-explicit N cycle, and examine model predictions of global change responses.
