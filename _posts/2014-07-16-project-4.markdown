description: Forests in the Eastern U.S. have received chronically high levels of nitrogen pollution - a consequence of coal burning. Nitrogen pollution has altered forests by changing how fast trees grow, the composition of plant species, and how much carbon they can store. All of these impacts have fundamentally disrupted plant and microbial interactions. We study this disruption at the Fernow Experimental Forest to determine whether plant-microbial interactions will recouple as nitrogen pollution fades across the region.
